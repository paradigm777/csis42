# Description: Program to take input in Python
int1 = input ("Please enter a number: ")
int2 = input ("Please enter a second number: ")
sum = int(int1) + int(int2)
prod = int(int1) * int(int2)
print("The sum of ", int1, " and ", int2, " is ", sum)
print("The product of ", int1, " and ", int2, " is ", prod)

# Algorithm:

# 1) Ask the user to enter two numbers.

# 2) store those two numbers in 2 variables, num1, num2.

# 3) make two new variables sum = num1+ num2, and product = num1*num2

# 4) Then, output the sum and product of to the user.

# Sample Program Run:

# Please enter number 1: 10

# Please enter number 2: 20

# The sum of 10 and 20 is 30

# The product of 10 and 20 is 200
